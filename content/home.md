Hi! 
I am currently a PhD candidate at the University of Toronto in the Department of Computer Science working at the intersection of human-computer interaction (HCI) and the commons.

My research examines efforts in online communities, such as Wikipedia and OpenStreetMap, that use commons-based approaches to self-govern and engage in the collective production of knowledge. In particular, I am interested in exploring the patterns of conflicts and tensions that emerge in the governance of the commons, as well as identifying the conditions under which conflict may be a creative or generative force, rather than destructive to the efforts of these communities to collectively accomplish their goals.
