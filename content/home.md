Hi! 
I am currently a PhD Student at the University of Toronto in the Department of Computer Science working on human-computer interaction (HCI), the commons, and climate adaptation practices. 

My current research examines the ways technologies and online communities can be designed as commons to support the democratic production of knowledge through collaborative efforts. I primarily employ qualitative, ethnographic, and participatory methods in my research.
