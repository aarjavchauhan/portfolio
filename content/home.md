Hi! 
I am currently a PhD candidate at the University of Toronto in the Department of Computer Science. I am interested in learning about the ways by which the design of technologies shape and intersect with the governance practices in collaborative and self-governing communities. I am an interdisciplinary researcher, drawing from qualitative, participatory, and ethnographic approaches within human-computer interaction (HCI), computer supported co-operative work (CSCW), and science & technology studies (STS).
